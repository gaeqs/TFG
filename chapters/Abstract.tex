This Master thesis has been developed within the Grupo de Modelado y Realidad Virtual (GMRV) of King Juan Carlos University of Madrid (URJC). It falls within the scope of neuroscientific simulation data analysis. For this reason, this work contemplate the design and implementation of two platforms, as possible solution to the treatment of neuroscientific simulation data (although can be extented to other areas).\\
In recent years the study of the brain has been one of the most studied subjects thanks to diverse international project such as the Human Brain project, Brain or Blue Brain Project, as well as the great use of artificial neural networks to improve computer algorithms.\\
Certainly, \textit{TEVimos} and \textit{CuViz} trying to search graphics solutions for simulation data analysis throught elevation maps and simulation summaries, respectively.\\
This proyect provides two very differentiated types of representation: Realtime simulation thanks to \textit{TEVimos} and simulation summaries (offline) through \textit{CuViz}.\\
The purpose of both platforms is to get that any center of work could visualize the information of his simulations to verfy, for example, if they have been realized correctly or detection of activity patters in neurons . With this, it will be possible contribute in the advance in the knowledge of the functioning of the neurons and the brain in his final set.
