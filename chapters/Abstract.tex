\delODR{This Degree} \newODR{This Bachelor's Thesis to obtain the Degree of Coputing Engineering} contemplates the design and development of \textit{JAMS},
a modern, lightweight and highly modifiable integrated
development environment for assembly language\delODR{s.
The application comes bundled with an editor, an assembler and
a simulator for the \textit{MIPS32} architecture, having
an academic approach.
To achieve this goal, the application contains several tools that
allow the user to see the state of the project from different
perspectives. \\
This application intends to contribute to a higher-quality education
for students that are taking a course related to architectures,
processing units or assembly language.}

\newODR{projects. The development environment incorporates by default an editor, assembler and simulator for the MIPS32 architecture, with an educational approach. For this purpose, the application presents several tools that allow visualizing the project status from different points of view.
With this, it is intended to contribute to a better quality teaching for students taking a subject related to computer architecture, processors or low-level programming languages.}
