\chapter{Abstract} \label{ch:abstract}

This Degree contemplates the design and development of \textit{JAMS},
a modern, lightweight and highly modifiable integrated
development environment for assembly languages.
The application comes bundled with an editor, an assembler and
a simulator for the \textit{MIPS32} architecture, having
an academic approach.
To achieve this goal, the application contains several tools that
allow the user to see the state of the project from different
perspectives. \\
This application intends to contribute to a higher-quality education
for students that are taking a course related to architectures,
processing units or assembly language.
