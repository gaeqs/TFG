\chapter{Abstract} \label{ch:abstract}

This Bachelor's Thesis to obtain the Degree of Coputing Engineering contemplates the design and development of \textit{JAMS},
a modern, lightweight and highly modifiable integrated
development environment for assembly language projects.
The development environment incorporates by default an editor,
assembler and simulator for the MIPS32 architecture, with an educational approach.
For this purpose, the application presents several tools that allow visualizing
the project status from different points of view.
With this, it is intended to contribute to a better quality
teaching for students taking a subject related to computer architecture,
processors or low-level programming languages.
